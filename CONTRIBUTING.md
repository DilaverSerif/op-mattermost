      - `sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/openproject/{pgdata, static}`
      - `docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name openproject -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=secret 
       -v /var/lib/openproject/pgdata:/var/openproject/pgdata

       openproject/community:11`
      - `docker stop openproject`
      - `docker start openproject`
    - For up-to-date info on OpenProject installation refer their [official docs](https://docs.openproject.org/installation-and-operations/installation/docker).
  - Mattermost

  - Node js
    - [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies

- Run `sh configure.sh` to create `.env` using bash command line. Alternatively, create a `.env` file using a text editor with the following entries:
    - `OP_URL=http://<your host or ip address>:8080/api/v3/   #needed for pointing to OpenProject installation`
    - `INT_URL=http://<your host or ip address>:3000/         #needed for exposing the integration running on port 3000`
    - `MM_URL=http://<your host or ip address>:8065/api/v4/   #needed for pointing to Mattermost installation`
    - `MATTERMOST_SLASH_TOKEN=<use the mattermost slash command token for logtime>  #needed for slash command validation`
    - `MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN=<use the mattermost bot access token>  #needed for validation for posting messages as bot`
    - `OP_ACCESS_TOKEN=<openproject access token (a.k.a apikey) obtained from user account page>`
- In the project root directory do `npm init` to generate (or update existing) `package.json` file
- Then run `npm install` to download and install the node modules from npm
- Run op-mattermost in the console using `npm start` (usually launches on port 3000)
- Create a custom Mattermost slash command `/op` as described [here](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/slash-commands.html) and provide localhost or IP address (with port 3000) as the request URL
- In OpenProject, create a custom field `billable hours` under `SPENT TIME` head for all work packages in a project
- Test the integration by trying `/op` in the message bar.
- Make code changes to fix bugs, create new features, tests and documentation updates
- Raise a pull request to the master branch. After review, the code changes shall be merged. 
- For detailed documentation of the project, refer the development wiki that is available [here](https://github.com/girish17/op-mattermost/wiki). It contains the workflows, file description and miscellaneous information necessary for development.
